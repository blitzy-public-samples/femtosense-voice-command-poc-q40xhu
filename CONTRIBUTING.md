## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Set up the development environment
   - Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed
   - Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Familiarize yourself with the project structure
   - Review the `README.md` file for an overview
   - Examine the `src` directory for the main codebase

## Code Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hinting for function parameters and return values
- Include docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules

Example:
```python
def generate_variations(phrase: str, count: int = 50) -> List[str]:
    """
    Generate variations of a given phrase.

    Args:
        phrase (str): The original phrase to generate variations for.
        count (int, optional): Number of variations to generate. Defaults to 50.

    Returns:
        List[str]: A list of generated phrase variations.
    """
    # Implementation here
```

### TypeScript Style Guide

- Follow the ESLint configuration provided in the project
- Use interfaces for defining complex types
- Organize code into modules for better maintainability

Example:
```typescript
interface VoiceCommand {
  intent: string;
  phrase: string;
  language: Language;
}

export function processCommand(command: VoiceCommand): void {
  // Implementation here
}
```

## Development Workflow

### Issue Creation

- Use the appropriate issue template (bug report or feature request)
- Provide detailed information, including steps to reproduce for bugs
- Label issues appropriately (e.g., bug, enhancement, documentation)

### Branching Strategy

- Use feature branches for new features: `feature/feature-name`
- Use bugfix branches for bug fixes: `bugfix/issue-description`

### Commit Guidelines

- Use clear and descriptive commit messages
- Link issues in commits using the format: "Fixes #123" or "Relates to #456"
- Make atomic commits (one logical change per commit)

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names: `test_should_generate_50_variations_when_given_valid_phrase`
- Use mocks for external dependencies (e.g., API calls)

### Integration Tests

- Cover key scenarios that involve multiple components
- Set up test environments that closely mimic production
- Handle test data carefully, avoiding exposure of sensitive information

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Document all public functions, classes, and modules
- Include example usage where appropriate
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

### API Documentation

- Use OpenAPI/Swagger standards for API documentation
- Document all endpoints, including request/response formats
- Include error responses and their meanings

## Pull Request Process

### PR Creation

- Use the provided pull request template
- Link related issues in the PR description
- Submit draft PRs for work-in-progress features

### Code Review

- Assign reviewers based on code ownership
- Respond to feedback within 2 business days
- Address all comments before requesting re-review

### Merge Requirements

- Ensure all CI/CD checks pass
- Obtain at least one approval from a code owner
- Update documentation if necessary

## Security Considerations

### API Key Handling

- Never commit API keys to the repository
- Use environment variables for storing sensitive information
- Implement secure key management practices

### Dependency Management

- Use only approved dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` or `package.json`
- Pin dependency versions to avoid unexpected updates
- Regularly run security vulnerability checks on dependencies

## Performance Guidelines

### Code Optimization

- Consider CPU usage, especially for voice processing functions
- Implement efficient memory management practices
- Optimize I/O operations, particularly for audio file handling

### AWS Resource Usage

- Follow S3 best practices for efficient storage
- Optimize Lambda functions for quick execution
- Implement cost-effective resource utilization strategies
